HW3: this HW is entirely included in the HW3 directory, with no Data or Analysis subdirectories.
This is largely due to the way wget works, and the fact that the data aren't really extracted to .csv except in the notebook code.
HW3_FurtherWeatherInvestigation.ipynb is the notebook with the fun stuff inside.
pronto_utils.py, as in lecture, includes background functions required for the notebook to function.
I included the .zip file of the data to spare you the extra download.
